## What is the Monty Hall Problem?

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. A player is shown three doors: behind one is a prize, and behind the other two are goats. After the player chooses a door, the host opens one of the remaining doors, revealing a goat. The player then has the option to stick with their original choice or switch to the other unopened door. The question is: *Is it better to switch or stay?*
