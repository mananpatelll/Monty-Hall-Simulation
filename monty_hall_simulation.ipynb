    "### Explanation for `elif change_door == 1` Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Idea\n",
    "If the player chooses to switch doors every time (`change_door == 1`), we can determine the outcome directly based on whether their **initial choice** (`selected_door`) was correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logic Breakdown\n",
    "1. **Initial Choice:**\n",
    "   - The player selects one of the three doors (`selected_door`).\n",
    "   - The door with the prize is determined (`door_with_price`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Monty’s Role:**\n",
    "   - Monty knows where the prize is.\n",
    "   - He opens one of the other two doors, ensuring it contains a goat.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Switching Outcome:**\n",
    "   - If the player's initial choice is **correct** (1/3 probability), switching will **always lose**, because the other unopened door contains a goat.\n",
    "   - If the player's initial choice is **incorrect** (2/3 probability), switching will **always win**, because the other unopened door contains the prize.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we only need to check:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if selected_door != door_with_price:\n",
    "    num_of_wins += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "This condition evaluates whether the player’s initial choice was incorrect, in which case switching guarantees a win.\n",
